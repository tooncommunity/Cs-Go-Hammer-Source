However, my friend showed more than me and get reports of about 10 people at the same time and he was banned. As you can see, the CS:GO cheat protection system is quite simple but brutal. Nevertheless, use it at the risk of VAC banning. I do not accept any liability if you are VAC banned. Use at your own risk.  🧨 Build your own instance I recommend you to use my builds in the Releases section, but you can also create your own ".exe" file by following the steps below.
